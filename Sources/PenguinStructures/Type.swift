/// A type whose full identity is known to the type system.
///
/// Generic function/method APIs often accept a `T.Type` parameter, where `T` is
/// a generic parameter, to drive deduction, for example:
///
///     extension UnsafeRawPointer {
///       func assumingMemoryBound<T>(to _: T.Type) -> UnsafePointer<T> { ... }
///     }
///
/// which is then used as follows:
///
///     someRawPointer.assumingMemoryBound(to: Foo.self)
///
/// The problem with such interfaces is that you can easily end up driving type
/// deduction with a value that doesn't match the deduced type:
///
///     let foo: Any.Type = Foo.self
///     assert(foo == Foo.self)
///     someRawPointer.assumingMemoryBound(to: foo) // not what you might expect
///
/// Despite the fact that the function argument is equal to `Foo.self`, the
/// deduced type of `T` is `Any`.  It isn't always obvious at the use site of
/// such an API that the *value* of the function argument is irrelevant and only
/// its type matters. To avoid this problem, we can instead use `Type<T>` in the
/// function signature:
///
///     extension UnsafeRawPointer {
///       func assumingMemoryBound<T>(to _: Type<T>) -> UnsafePointer<T> { ... }
///     }
///
/// which is then used as follows:
///
///     someRawPointer.assumingMemoryBound(to: Type<Foo>())
///
public struct Type<T> {
  public init() {}

  /// The `TypeID` value corresponding to `T`.
  public static var id: TypeID { .init(T.self) }
}
