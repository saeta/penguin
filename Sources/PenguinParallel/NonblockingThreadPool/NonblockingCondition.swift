/// Allows to wait for arbitrary predicates in non-blocking algorithms.
///
/// You can think of `NonblockingCondition` as a condition variable, but the predicate to wait upon
/// does not need to be protected by a mutex. Using `NonblockingCondition` in a non-blocking
/// algorithm (instead of spinning) allows threads to go sleep, saving potentially significant
/// amounts of CPU resources.
///
/// To use `NonblockingCondition`, your algorithm should look like the following:
///
/// ```
/// let nbc = NonblockingCondition(...) 
///
/// // Waiting thread:
/// if predicate { return doWork() }
/// nbc.preWait(threadId)
/// if predicate {
///	  nbc.cancelWait(threadId)
///   return doWork()
/// }
/// nbc.commitWait(threadId)  // Puts current thread to sleep until notified.
///
/// // Notifying thread:
/// predicate = true
/// nbc.notify()  // or nbc.notifyAll()
/// ```
///
/// Notifying is cheap if there are no waiting threads. preWait and commitWait are not cheap, but
/// they should only be executed if the preceding predicate check failed. This yields an efficient
/// system in the general case where there is low contention.
final public class NonblockingCondition<Environment: ConcurrencyPlatform> {
  // Algorithm outline:
  //
  // There are two main variables: the predicate (which is managed by the user of
  // NonblockingCondition), and state. The operation closely resembles the Dekker algorithm:
  // https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dekker%27s_algorithm.
  //
  // The waiting thread sets state, and checks predicate. The notifying thread sets the predicate
  // and then checks state. Due to the seq_cst fences in between these operations, it is guaranteed
  // that either the waiter will see the predicate change and won't block, or the notifying thread
  // will see the state change, and will unblock the waiter, or both. But it is impossible that both
  // threads don't see each other's changes, as that would lead to a deadlock.
  //
  // This implementation is heavily inspired by event_count.h from the Eigen library.
