/// Abstracts over storage location for values associated with graphs.
///
/// Graph algorithms often need to store data during the course of execution, such as vertex color
/// (during search), or the costs of traversing an edge (e.g. Dijkstra's algorithm). While some
/// graph types can store data within the graph structure itself. (e.g. `AdjacencyList` allows
/// associating data with every vertex and edge.) Some graph data structures are not materialized
/// whatsoever (e.g. the possible moves on a knight's tour on a chess board). Additionally, data is
/// often needed only during the course of an algorithm, and is discarded afterwards. As a result,
/// it would be inefficient to pay the cost of requiring every graph implementation to persist this
/// transient state. Fortunately, property maps allow us to leverage "in-graph" storage when it
/// is available, while also allowing data to be stored outside the graph when convenient as well,
/// all behind a single abstraction. In short, thanks to the PropertyMap protocol, we can write an
/// algorithm once using one or more PropertyMap's, and the algorithm can be re-used independent of
/// whether the data is stored within the graph data structure or in a separate data structure.
